## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Development

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd JotformFrontendHackathon
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Jotform API
- Edit `src/utils/util.ts`:
  - Set `FORM_ID` to your Jotform form ID
  - Set `API_KEY` to your Jotform API key (for demo/test only in your local; do **not** expose in production)

### 4. Run the App (Development)
```sh
npm run dev
```
- Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## üìù How It Works

1. **Product Listing:**
   - Fetches product/payment fields from the Jotform API using the configured `FORM_ID`.
2. **Cart Management:**
   - Users can add/remove/update products in the cart. Cart state is managed globally.
3. **Checkout:**
   - User fills in Full Name and Address. Cart summary is shown. Submission is sent to Jotform API as a native submission (correct field ids, payment field structure).
4. **Order Submission:**
   - Uses Jotform‚Äôs `form/:formId/submissions` endpoint. Handles all required field formats for payment/product fields.
5. **Route Protection:**
   - Checkout page is only accessible if there are items in the shopping card.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices
- **API Key Exposure:**
  - The API key is in the frontend for demo purposes only. For real projects, use a backend proxy or environment variables.
- **Route Guards:**
  - Checkout is protected; users can‚Äôt access it directly when the shopping card is empty.
- **Component Organization:**
  - Routing logic is separated under `routes/` for maintainability.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All API and user errors are caught and displayed.

---

## üí° Customization
- **Change Form:**
  - Update `FORM_ID` in `util.ts` to connect to any Jotform form with compatible fields.
- **Add Features:**
  - Extend with user authentication, order history, payment gateways, etc.
- **Styling:**
  - Easily customize with TailwindCSS classes or add your own styles.

## üôã FAQ

**Q: Can I use my own Jotform?**  
A: Yes! Change the `FORM_ID` and ensure your Jotform has compatible product/payment fields.

**Q: Is my API key safe?**  
A: No, never expose your API key in production. This is for demo/hackathon use only.

**Q: Where do orders go?**  
A: Orders are submitted directly to your Jotform account and visible in the Jotform submissions panel.
